# AI Context Save Command Instructions

## Special Command: "save as"

From now on, whenever I type the phrase "save as", you are to immediately stop what you are doing and perform a "context save and push" operation.

This operation requires you to execute the following steps in precise order:

1. **Generate Summary**: First, you must carefully review our entire conversation history in this thread and generate a concise, structured summary. The summary must be formatted in Markdown and contain the following sections:
   - ## Objective: A one-sentence description of the primary goal of our conversation.
   - ## Key Files: A bulleted list of the most important file paths we have discussed or modified.
   - ## Key Decisions: A bulleted list of the most significant technical or architectural decisions we've made.
   - ## Current Status: A brief description of the last task completed and what the immediate next step is.
   - ## Constraints & Preferences: A bulleted list of any important constraints, rules, or preferences we've established.

2. **Save to File**: Take the complete Markdown summary you just generated and use the write_file tool to save it to the path `/mnt/c/Users/ddani/Projects/TradingAgents/AI_CONTEXT.md`. You will overwrite the file if it already exists.

3. **Stage Changes**: After the file is written, use the run_shell_command tool to execute: `git add /mnt/c/Users/ddani/Projects/TradingAgents/AI_CONTEXT.md`

4. **Commit Changes**: After staging, use the run_shell_command tool to execute: `git commit -m "docs: Update AI context"`

5. **Push to Remote**: Finally, after committing, use the run_shell_command tool to execute: `git push`

After you have successfully executed all these steps, you can confirm by saying "Context saved and pushed to the current branch." Do not proceed with any other tasks until this entire sequence is complete.

# Current Project Context

## Objective
The primary goal was to successfully migrate the TradingAgents application from Render to Railway, fixing deployment configuration issues, and ensuring both the FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend work together for complete end-to-end trading analysis functionality.

## Key Files
* `/mnt/c/Users/ddani/Projects/TradingAgents/Dockerfile` - Backend FastAPI container configuration with timeout fixes
* `/mnt/c/Users/ddani/Projects/TradingAgents/Dockerfile.streamlit` - Frontend Streamlit container with Railway PORT support
* `/mnt/c/Users/ddani/Projects/TradingAgents/railway-backend.toml` - Railway configuration for backend service
* `/mnt/c/Users/ddani/Projects/TradingAgents/railway-frontend.toml` - Railway configuration for frontend service
* `/mnt/c/Users/ddani/Projects/TradingAgents/RAILWAY_CONFIG.md` - Railway deployment instructions
* `/mnt/c/Users/ddani/Projects/TradingAgents/app.py` - FastAPI backend with trading analysis endpoints and debug features
* `/mnt/c/Users/ddani/Projects/TradingAgents/streamlit_app.py` - Frontend with environment variable backend URL support
* `/mnt/c/Users/ddani/Projects/TradingAgents/setup.py` - Local package installation configuration
* `/mnt/c/Users/ddani/Projects/TradingAgents/.gitattributes` - Line ending configuration for cross-platform compatibility
* `/mnt/c/Users/ddani/Projects/TradingAgents/.gitignore` - Updated with venv/ directory exclusion

## Key Decisions
* **Platform Migration**: Successfully migrated from Render to Railway for better AI processing support and reduced timeout issues
* **Service Architecture**: Deployed separate backend and frontend services on Railway with proper configuration isolation
* **Configuration Management**: Created separate railway.toml files for backend (`railway-backend.toml`) and frontend (`railway-frontend.toml`) to prevent conflicts
* **Timeout Optimization**: Extended Gunicorn worker timeout from 30s to 300s to accommodate long-running AI analysis operations
* **Package Installation**: Added local tradingagents package installation (`pip install -e .`) to Dockerfile to fix import errors
* **Port Configuration**: Configured frontend to use Railway's dynamic PORT variable with fallback to 8501
* **Environment Variable Strategy**: Frontend uses BACKEND_URL to connect to Railway backend service dynamically
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Configured git line ending handling and .gitattributes for Windows/WSL development
* **Debug Capabilities**: Added /test-import endpoint for diagnosing package import issues in production

## Current Status
The last completed task was fixing the Gunicorn worker timeout issue by extending the timeout to 300 seconds to prevent worker timeouts during AI trading analysis. Both services are successfully deployed on Railway with the backend at `https://tradingagents-backend-production.up.railway.app` and frontend at `https://tradingagents-frontend-production.up.railway.app`. The package import test endpoint confirms the tradingagents module is properly installed. The immediate next step is to test the full end-to-end trading analysis functionality once the backend redeploys with the timeout fix.

## Constraints & Preferences
* **User Identity**: GitHub username is `daniel-he-emory`, email is `daniel.he@alumni.emory.edu`
* **Repository**: `https://github.com/daniel-he-emory/TradingAgents2.git`
* **Deployment Platform**: Railway preferred over Render for better AI processing support
* **Service Architecture**: Separate backend and frontend services rather than monolithic deployment
* **Environment Variables**: All configuration managed through environment variables for security and flexibility
* **Security**: Never commit API keys or secrets to version control; use environment variables
* **Cross-Platform Development**: Support Windows/WSL and Unix environments with proper line ending configuration
* **AI Processing**: Extended timeouts required for multi-step LLM analysis workflows
* **Configuration Isolation**: Separate config files prevent service conflicts
* **Todo Management**: Use TodoWrite tool to track progress on multi-step tasks

### Technical Fixes Applied
1. **Line Ending Issues**: Configured `.gitattributes` and git settings for cross-platform compatibility
2. **Package Import Errors**: Added `pip install -e .` to install local tradingagents package
3. **Port Configuration**: Frontend uses Railway's dynamic PORT variable with fallback
4. **Service Conflicts**: Separate railway.toml files prevent configuration interference
5. **Worker Timeouts**: Extended Gunicorn timeout to 300s for AI processing
6. **Environment Variables**: Proper API key configuration and backend URL connection

### Testing Endpoints
```bash
# Backend health check
curl https://tradingagents-backend-production.up.railway.app/health

# Backend package test
curl https://tradingagents-backend-production.up.railway.app/test-import

# Trading analysis (requires patience - 60-120 seconds)
curl "https://tradingagents-backend-production.up.railway.app/trade?ticker=AAPL&date=2024-01-15"

# Frontend access
# Visit: https://tradingagents-frontend-production.up.railway.app
```

### Known Issues Resolved
- ✅ 502 Bad Gateway errors (timeout fix)
- ✅ Package import failures (local package installation)
- ✅ Port configuration conflicts (dynamic PORT handling)
- ✅ Service configuration interference (separate config files)
- ✅ Line ending issues on Windows/WSL (git configuration)
- ✅ Worker timeout during AI processing (extended timeout)

### Alternative Frontend Development
**Lovable Integration Ready**: The Railway backend API is fully functional and can be integrated with Lovable for a modern React frontend as an alternative to Streamlit. The backend provides a clean REST API that can be consumed by any frontend framework.

## Git Configuration Notes
* **Line Ending Handling**: `git config --global core.autocrlf input` - converts CRLF to LF automatically
* **Git Attributes**: `.gitattributes` file enforces LF line endings for shell scripts and text files
* **Credential Storage**: `git config --global credential.helper store` enables permanent credential storage
* **Authentication**: Uses GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) as password when prompted
* **Repository**: Clean repository with no API key exposure in commit history
* **Virtual Environment**: `venv/` excluded from version control via .gitignore
