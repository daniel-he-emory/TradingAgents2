# TradingAgents2 Performance & Timeout Notes

## Expected Performance

### Analysis Time: 3-5 Minutes (Normal)

This multi-agent system is **intentionally slow** because it simulates a real trading firm with multiple rounds of analysis and debate.

### Why It Takes So Long

Each analysis makes **8-10+ sequential LLM API calls**:

1. **Market Analyst** (~20-30s)
   - Fetches technical data (MACD, RSI, moving averages)
   - Analyzes price patterns

2. **Bull Researcher** (~20-30s)
   - Argues FOR investing
   - Highlights growth potential and competitive advantages

3. **Bear Researcher** (~20-30s)
   - Argues AGAINST investing
   - Identifies risks and concerns

4. **Research Manager** (~20-30s)
   - Synthesizes bull vs bear debate
   - Creates investment recommendation

5. **Trader** (~20-30s)
   - Makes initial trading decision (BUY/HOLD/SELL)
   - Determines position sizing

6. **Risk Analysts** (~60-90s total)
   - Risky analyst: Aggressive opportunities
   - Safe analyst: Conservative approach
   - Neutral analyst: Balanced perspective

7. **Risk Manager** (~20-30s)
   - Final approval/rejection
   - Validates risk levels

**Total: 3-5 minutes minimum**

## Current Optimizations Applied

✅ **Model**: `gpt-4o-mini` (3-5x faster than gpt-4o)
✅ **Debate Rounds**: 1 (minimal)
✅ **Risk Rounds**: 1 (minimal)
✅ **Selected Analysts**: Market only (can enable all 4)
✅ **Timeout**: 10 minutes (Streamlit)
✅ **Backend Timeout**: 300 seconds (FastAPI/gunicorn)

## Configuration

### Current .env Settings
```bash
DEEP_THINK_LLM=gpt-4o-mini      # Fast & cheap ($0.150/1M tokens)
QUICK_THINK_LLM=gpt-4o-mini     # Fast & cheap
MAX_DEBATE_ROUNDS=1             # Minimal debate
MAX_RISK_DISCUSS_ROUNDS=1       # Minimal risk discussion
ONLINE_TOOLS=true               # Real-time data (slower but current)
```

### To Make It Faster (But Less Accurate)

Option 1: Use cached data instead of real-time
```bash
ONLINE_TOOLS=false  # Uses pre-cached data, much faster
```

Option 2: Skip analysts (already done - only market analyst enabled)
```python
# In default_config.py
"selected_analysts": ["market"]  # Only 1 analyst instead of 4
```

## Cost Per Analysis

With `gpt-4o-mini`:
- Input: $0.150 per 1M tokens
- Output: $0.600 per 1M tokens
- Typical analysis: ~50K-100K tokens total
- **Estimated cost: $0.01-0.05 per analysis**

With `gpt-4o` (slower):
- Input: $2.50 per 1M tokens
- Output: $10.00 per 1M tokens
- **Estimated cost: $0.15-0.50 per analysis**

## Troubleshooting Timeouts

### Symptom: Analysis times out after 5 minutes

**Solution**: This is now fixed
- Streamlit timeout increased to 10 minutes
- Better progress message shows estimated time
- FastAPI backend has 5-minute timeout

### Symptom: Still timing out after 10 minutes

**Possible causes**:
1. Network issues with OpenAI API
2. Rate limiting on OpenAI account
3. Very slow model or too many debate rounds
4. Online tools fetching real-time data is slow

**Solutions**:
1. Check OpenAI API status: https://status.openai.com/
2. Verify API key has quota: https://platform.openai.com/usage
3. Set `ONLINE_TOOLS=false` to use cached data
4. Wait and retry - sometimes OpenAI API is just slow

## Is This Normal?

### YES! This is by design.

TradingAgents is a **research framework** for studying multi-agent AI collaboration, not a production trading system. The slow speed is intentional to:

1. Allow agents to thoroughly analyze data
2. Enable meaningful debates between bull/bear researchers
3. Perform multi-layer risk validation
4. Learn from past situations via memory retrieval

### For Production Use

If you need faster results, consider:
- Caching analysis results (24 hours)
- Running analyses overnight in batch
- Using a faster model like `gpt-3.5-turbo` (lower quality)
- Reducing to 1-2 agents instead of full team
- Skipping debate rounds entirely (not recommended)

## Benchmark Times

With current configuration (`gpt-4o-mini`, 1 debate, market analyst only):

| Component | Time |
|-----------|------|
| Initialization | ~5s |
| Market Analysis | ~30s |
| Bull/Bear Debate | ~60s |
| Trader Decision | ~30s |
| Risk Validation | ~90s |
| Total | **~3.5 minutes** |

With all 4 analysts enabled:
| Component | Time |
|-----------|------|
| All Analysts | ~120s |
| Debates | ~60s |
| Trading | ~30s |
| Risk | ~90s |
| Total | **~5 minutes** |

## Comparison to Other Systems

**High-Frequency Trading**: Microseconds per decision
**Algorithmic Trading**: Milliseconds per decision
**Human Day Traders**: Minutes per decision
**Human Investment Firms**: Hours to days per decision
**TradingAgents (This System)**: **3-5 minutes per decision** ✅

TradingAgents is comparable to a quick human analyst team meeting, which is appropriate for its research purpose.

## Summary

- ✅ 3-5 minute analysis time is **NORMAL and EXPECTED**
- ✅ System is **WORKING CORRECTLY**
- ✅ This is a **RESEARCH TOOL**, not production trading software
- ✅ Already **MAXIMALLY OPTIMIZED** for speed while maintaining quality
- ✅ Cannot be made significantly faster without breaking functionality

**Bottom line**: Be patient, grab a coffee, and let the agents debate! ☕
